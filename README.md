Stardazed Web Streams Implementation
====================================
A fully compliant implementation of and polyfill for the
[Web Streams Standard Specification](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org) plus related types
from the [Encoding Standard](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org).

This repository is a so-called monorepo, it contains several packages that
together make up a group of related functionality. Currently included are:

ðŸ‘‰ [@stardazed/streams](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stardazed/streams) â€”
a full implementation of the streams standard with no dependencies that works
in all (reasonably) modern browsers and in Node.

ðŸ‘‰ [@stardazed/streams-fetch-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stardazed/streams-fetch-adapter) â€”
helper functions to create custom versions of `fetch` and `Response` types
to enable any (mock) implementation of the streams standard to work directly
with `fetch`, including uploads using streams.

ðŸ‘‰ [@stardazed/streams-text-encoding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stardazed/streams-text-encoding) â€”
an implementation of the `TextDecoderStream` and `TextEncoderStream` from the
Encoding standard, linking the two standards for best compatibility and reusability.

ðŸ‘‰ [@stardazed/streams-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stardazed/streams-polyfill) â€”
a polyfill combining the above two packages for a seamless, drop-in integration
of stardazed streams + fetch in modern browsers and Node.
